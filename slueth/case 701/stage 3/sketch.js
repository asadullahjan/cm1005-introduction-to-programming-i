Case 701 - Recognisable robber - stage 3

Kid youâ€™re becoming a victim of your own success.
I just had a call from DI Max down at the precinct. He specifically requested your services.
They finally have a reliable witness for a robber who has been causing mayhem for some months.
Luckily they have a witness statement from jaunita joyer. You know what to do kid.


The function is already being called in draw() but it is your job to implement it.

There are many possible ways of carrying out your duties,
but you should complete this task using ONLY the following
commands:

 - function matchProperties(suspectObj){}
 - if()

Witness statement:

It all started when I was exiting the store. That's when I noticed them. They had thick black hair. I'll never forget their brown eyes. It was very dark and I could barely see, They were carrying a brown paper bag. They seemed to be between the age of 18 and 50 years old. They were wearing a yellow poncho. They brobably weigh between 58 and 77 kg. It's so hard to remember right now. I distinctly remember that they were wearing a net weave shirt, I remember thinking that was quite unusual. They were fairly tall, I think between a height of 170 and 188 cm. Can I go home now Sir?
